        <p>
          If you need me, I'll be down here on the floor. Dying. I'm no hero. I just put my bra on one boob at a time. How do you know a python ate it? Did it leave a note? C'mon Dad, just let me bite down on the bean. If I were a hamburger you'd come and watch! Gene, you saved us. I owe you my life. Hey Jimmy Jr. Did you see those two squirrels fighting in the courtyard? Let's raise our glasses! You're right. I'm a firestarter and a jinx. I'm going to destroy this whole family. It's an erotic friend fiction story that I just wrote. I hope you like it, because you're all in it. It's called 'Buttloose.' Put it on a t-shirt, Jimmy Jr, I don't want to hear it. I'm a smart, strong, sensual woman. Dad, you're the best pimp a girl could ever have. I thought I saw a baby bump.

          Dear God, this is Tina from school. There's a lot of carrots in that stew. There is one place I like to go. The boys' locker room. You can only see up to their ankles. Not if you're a fish. There is one place I like to go. The boys' locker room. You can only see up to their ankles. Ok then, see you on our date! Dad, you're the best pimp a girl could ever have. Buns...sen. Your ass is grass and I'm gonna mow it. My bra's chafing me. Argh!... Wait, I like the library. Dear God, this is Tina from school. Chad the Zombie touched the butt of that girl with the frosted hair from my art class. I think her name is Kristi. How do you know a python ate it? Did it leave a note?

          The hand wants what the hand wants. Put it on a t-shirt, Jimmy Jr, I don't want to hear it. uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh My boob? If you need me, I'll be down here on the floor. Dying. Tina reached towards Jimmy Junior's butt: 'Your lips say no but your butt says yes.' Dad, I need you to drop everything and shave my legs. I know how the shark thinks. It's confused. It doesn't know why we want to kill it. It just wants to go home. YOU GORGEOUS IDIOT! Sausage leather belts. My crotch is itchy. Butts. I want a dry erase board so I can write down all my private thoughts and then erase them immediately. Do you think horses get songs stuck in their heads?
